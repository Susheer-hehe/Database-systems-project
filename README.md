This project implements the backend database system for a fictional **Video Game Store**. It includes entities for managing customers, products (games, consoles, PC parts), sales, rentals, inventory, and more.

The database is designed in **SQL Server Management System**, normalized to **3NF**, and demonstrates:
- Table relationships using **foreign keys**.
- Sample data for testing.
- CRUD operations and complex SQL queries for analytics.

An ERD of the database has been provided aswell.

For restoring the Database a backup file has been created inside the PC.

SQL files have been posted on:
1- Creating Tables.
2- Adding Primary Key and Foreign Key relations.
3- Inserting Values into the tables.
4- Running Sample Queries.
